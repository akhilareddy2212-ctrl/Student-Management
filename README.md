# Student Management System â€“ Python Project

## Project Overview
This is a **console-based Student Management System** built in Python. The system allows a small college to maintain student records (up to 8 students) including **ID, Name, Course, and Marks**. It uses **functions only** (no OOP, no database, no file handling) to perform CRUD operations.

   - Restrict maximum students to 8  
   - Course must be one of: **CS, ECE, IT, MECH, CIVIL**  

2. **View Students**  
   - Display all student records in a tabular format  

3. **Search Student**  
   - Search by **ID** or **Name**  

4. **Update Student**  
   - Modify **Course** or **Marks** for a student  

5. **Delete Student**  
   - Remove a student record by ID  

6. **Exit Program**  
   - End the application gracefully  

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- Knowledge of:
  - Lists & dictionaries  
  - Functions  
  - Loops & conditionals
